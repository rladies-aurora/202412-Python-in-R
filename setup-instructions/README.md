These instructions were created using computers that satisfied these requirements (i.e., no promises they will work on other systems):

 - runs one of the following operating systems: macOS 12.0.1 (Monterey), Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 10 Professional, Enterprise or Education; version 2004.
    - **Windows 10 Home is not sufficient** as not all the software required for the program can be installed on that OS. [Click here to download Windows 10 Education for free from UBC.](https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads)
    - When installing Ubuntu, checking the box "Install third party..." will (among other things) install proprietary drivers, which can be helpful for wifi and graphics cards.

- has at least 50 GB disk space available
